ðŸ“š I am thrilled to announce our new work **Path-PKT**: [Towards Understanding and Harnessing the Transferability of Prognostic Knowledge in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482). This work presents the first systematic study on *prognostic knowledge transfer in pathology* towards understanding and harnessing the transferability of histological features for cancer prognosis. Paper interpretation can be found at [Zhihu (ä¸­æ–‡)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1941437125628268702). Its [source code](https://github.com/liupei101/Path-PKT), [UNI2-h-DSS dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuukilp/UNI2-h-DSS), and [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13482) have been released.
