:fire: I am thrilled to announce our new work **Path-PKT**: Towards Understanding and Harnessing the Transferability of Prognostic Knowledge in Computational Pathology. This work presents the first systematic study on *prognostic knowledge transfer in pathology* towards understanding and harnessing the transferability of histological features for cancer prognosis. Please check our [Github Repo](https://github.com/liupei101/Path-PKT) for more details. Paper & code will be released later; stay tuned.
