📚 I am thrilled to announce our new work **CROPKT**: [Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482). This work presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on *cross-cancer knowledge transfer in WSI-based prognosis prediction* to gain deeper insights into cross-cancer knowledge transfer and show its utility in WSI-based prognosis. Paper interpretation can be found at [Zhihu (Chinese version)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1941437125628268702). Its [source code](https://github.com/liupei101/CROPKT), [UNI2-h-DSS dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuukilp/UNI2-h-DSS), and [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13482) have been released.
