🎉 Our work **STEPH** (Sparse Task Vector Mixup with Hypernetworks for Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Whole-Slide Image Prognosis) is accepted to [CVPR 2026](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2026). As a continuation of [CROPKT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482), this work presents an efficient solution: prognosis knowledge transfer via model merging. Paper and codes will be released soon. Stay tuned.
