I am an in-coming Postdoc research fellow at [Hunan University](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), expected to start from Sept. 2025. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [X. Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B20HBMIAAAAJ). Prior to that, I had a wonderful four-year journey at [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and got my Ph.D. degree in Jun. 2025 under supervision of Prof. [L. Ji](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/jiluping/zh_CN/index.htm). I obtained my B.E./M.S. degree in computer science at UESTC in 2017/2020. 

***Research Interest***: My research interests cover many aspects of machine learning and its applications in healthcare.
- Machine Learning: 1) **Multiple Instance Learning** (MIL), particularly the new issues posed by weak supervision; 2) **Bayesian inference and uncertainty modeling**, with more focus on NN-based approaches; and 3) **Survival analysis**, mainly in unbiased modeling for censored individuals.
- **Computational Pathology** (CPATH): utilizing efficient deep learning methods and explainable tools to unlock the potiential of Whole-Slide Image (WSI) for precise and personalized cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. I would like to devote myself to this direction for long-term and focus on cutting-edge research. 

***Publication & Activities***: Most of my research papers have been published in interdisciplinary journals and computer science conferences, such as [ICML](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc), [ICLR](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc), [AAAI](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org), [IEEE TMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=42), and [MedIA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis). A full publication list can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FNghdtEAAAAJ) or [here](https://liupei101.github.io/publications/). I also serve as reviewer in 
- Conferences: ICML (2025), ICLR (2025), NeurIPS (2024, 2025), AAAI (2026), AISTATS (2025);
- Journals: IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMI, TMLR, MedIA, IEEE JBHI, ESWA, Computers in Biology and Medicine. 

***More Things***: N/A.
